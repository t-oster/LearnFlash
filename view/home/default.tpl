  <p>Tired of wasting your time writing flashcards for your exam?</br>
  We are proposing a modern and efficient way for preparing and
  ordering your</br> flashcards which will improve your learning experience.</p>
  
  <p><b> How to learn the flashcards? </b></p>
  <p>Go to <b>CARDS</b> for creating a new flash card. Fill in the Title-field
  to name your card.</br> Use the front side for the question and
  the back side for the answer.</br> Be surprised: you are able
  to use Latex and HTML tags inside your card!</br>
  Don't forget to write some tags for the better overview when you are going to learn!</p>
  
  <p>After creating some cards you can now make a test of your
    knowledge.</br> Go to <b>LEARN</b> and choose which cards you want to learn:
  you have here</br> the three possibilities:
  <ul class="list">
     <li>Learn all cards</li>
     <li>Learn only cards with selected tags</li>
     <li>Learn unlearned cards (if you have learned some of them already!)</li>
  </ul>
</p>
  
  <p>In Options you can choose from several orders in which the cards will
  be shown.</br> We have prepared something special for you:
  SuperMemo2(SM2) algorithm!</br> 
  This is a spaced repetition learning method, which has shown good results</br>
  in optimization of long term learning</p>
  
  <p>Go to <b>Mindmap</b> and make a structured visualization of your flashcards.</br>
  You can sort all available cards depending on tags and select the ones you
  want</br> to create a mindmap.</p>
  
  <p>We hope that you will enjoy the <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FF0000">Smart</font><font color="#0000FF">Card</font><font color="#00C000">Learn</font></FONT>!</br>

  And now, don't wait, start creating your flashcard set!!
